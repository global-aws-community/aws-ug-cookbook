The most common and manageable format is speaker-led sessions resembling lectures or seminars. also Q&A session after Keynote session satisfy many participants as well.

To add a personal experience, in the early days of the Guro Digital(#gudi) meetup, I felt pressured to hold monthly events regularly. (there were some other organizers who felt the same as well) Sometimes, there were no speakers for the next month's event. To maintain the meetup, I volunteered to prepare and present my experiences with AWS.

This became my first AWS community presentation, fulfilling my aspiration since joining the meetup.

### Discussions

As meetup operations matured, we organized several discussions without speakers. We shared a Google Slide with a common topic for participants to discuss.
(ex. the topic was "Your thoughts on DevOps?")

There are 2 cases we already hosted discussion meetups.
- Case 1: Shared a blank Google Slide for participants to edit and add their thoughts on the topic.
Each person come out to the desk front, briefly speak about their thoughts then doing casual discussion with other participants.
- Case 2: Before the event, need to invite some experts of the topic we're gonna discuss. and at event, share a blank Google Slide for participants to edit and add their thoughts on the topic.

### Hands-on sessions

Before the pandemic, we held hands-on sessions on AWS basics that even beginners could follow for about four hours. We invited participants on weekends.

Multiple community members passionately contributed to preparing these sessions, assisting participants during the events, and resolving unexpected situations. Despite the energy required, successfully completing these events brought immense satisfaction.

## 2. Find venue

Usually organizer of meetup ask to their company to do reservation of the venue.
or ask some passionate participant if your company is willing to sponsor the venue.
then we allow the sponsor to promote their thing the sponsor want to promote to the participants. we allow this sponsor promotion time in lightening talk timing.

## 3. Manage attendance fee

To run the meetup without getting sponsored by anyone, we create bank account to collect the attendance fee.
We ask to participant attendance fee as minimum price as possible for participant don't feel burden or getting pressure.
Here is the 2 main reason we set the attendance fee
1. To prevent no-show
2. To prepare snacks

## 4. Manage the event via meetup

Content is ready, Venue is ready, Bank account is ready, then we post to the [meetup.com](meetup.com).

Each meetup has a treasurer responsible for managing participation fees, and each meetup has its own account. When participation fees are received in the meetup account, the treasurer checks the payment status by comparing the names of the participants who paid the fee with those who applied for the meetup.

However, sometimes there are situations where the participant who paid the fee does not match the meetup ID. In such cases, asking participants to enter their real names in the meetup registration form usually resolves the issue. If the payer is still not identified, DMs are sent to the meetup participants or inquiries are made in the Slack meetup channel.

or preparing [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19enBafDS8ZH4Ua7IKKYZVh5qozJl4_1BW9RrkNSMAYg/edit) to collect information of meetup ID and real name

## 5. Manage snacks

<img src="https://media2.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffjjmm7571bcl71pqe4m0.png" width="400" />

The snacks we prepare have evolved over time. In 2017, it was mainly one roll of kimbap and carbonated drinks.

Later, we ordered pizza and divided it into 2-3 slices each, and now we prepare various snacks such as toast, sandwiches, and hamburgers.

Due to price increases after the pandemic, there are often cases where the snack order amount exceeds the participation fee of 5000 won ($3.62 as of 06.08), leading to an increase in meetup fees.

Currently, there are two opinions among organizers, and some meetups have raised their fees to provide better quality snacks.

So try to choose the menu with reasonable price no expensive than the money your meetup bank account have.

## 6. Icebreaking and Networking

The organizer strives to provide positive experiences for participants so they can feel welcomed, gain a sense of belonging, find the courage to share their experiences, and actively express their opinions.

- Korean participants often feel awkward and have difficulty expressing themselves at first. Therefore, the meetup begins with introductions from the organizers and participants. This helps participants gain the experience of speaking up, making it easier for them to engage in Q&A sessions or networking activities later on.
- During networking time, snacks are prepared at each table to create an environment where people can naturally have conversations while enjoying the food.
- On one occasion, the networking atmosphere was so lively that the meetup exceeded its scheduled end time, causing inconvenience to an adjacent office worker who was working overtime.
- Although the inconvenience to the neighbor was regrettable, the event was evaluated as a success.
- To ensure smooth operations, time management is necessary to conclude the event within the designated timeframe, even if the networking is highly active.

After the meetup, we sometimes arrange additional networking time at a nearby pub.
This external networking provides a great opportunity for participants to build closer connections and generally results in high satisfaction.
However, from the organizer's perspective, it can be quite energy-intensive, and since the number of attendees is not always clear, having more than 20 people suddenly show up at a pub can lead to space issues.
Therefore, if there are multiple organizers, one organizer could consider reserving a space 30 minutes before the meetup begins.

## 7. Organizing Event Content

After each event, presentation slides or discussion history are organized and uploaded to the [AWSKRUG meetup GitHub repository](https://github.com/awskrug/). Additionally, some meetups record the presentations during the event or upload them to the [AWSKRUG YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@awskrug) via live streaming.
