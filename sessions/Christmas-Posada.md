# Christmas Posada

## Introduction

The Christmas Posada consists of coming together to celebrate a very special time of the year. It is a moment to reflect on everything we experienced throughout the past months, to share gratitude for the journey, and to embrace the joy that the holiday season brings.

This Posada is also the perfect occasion to look back at the Meetups we hosted during the year, highlight what we learned together, and share the vision of what lies ahead for the upcoming year. More than just a tradition, it is an opportunity to connect with friends, colleagues, and community, while preparing our hearts for Christmas and the new opportunities to come.

## Objective

The purpose of the Christmas Posada (Meetup) is to celebrate the season, reflect on the year’s Meetups, and gain valuable AWS insights from our speaker—strengthening our community while looking ahead to the new year.
